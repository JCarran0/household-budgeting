## Risk Treatment Strategies

### Accept
- **R009:** Insider threat risk is low due to single-person operation
- Monitor and review quarterly

### Mitigate
- **R001, R003, R011:** Implement additional technical controls
- **R006, R013:** Enhance security awareness and training
- **R012:** Improve password management practices

### Transfer
- **R007:** Use AWS service credits and SLA guarantees
- **R010:** Require cyber insurance from key vendors

### Avoid
- **R014:** Implement comprehensive backup and recovery procedures
- **R005:** Enhance change management and approval processes

## Control Effectiveness Assessment

### Existing Controls Performance

| Control Type | Control Description | Effectiveness Rating | Comments |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Technical | Multi-factor authentication | High | Working well, 100% adoption |
| Technical | Data encryption at rest | High | AES-256 implemented |
| Technical | Data encryption in transit | High | TLS 1.3 for all connections |
| Administrative | Access control procedures | Medium | Need regular review process |
| Administrative | Security awareness training | Medium | Need to formalize program |
| Physical | Device security | Medium | Full disk encryption implemented |
| Technical | Backup procedures | Medium | Need automated testing |
| Technical | Vulnerability management | Low | Need automated scanning |

### Control Gaps and Recommendations

1. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement regular automated scans
2. **Formal Training Program:** Develop structured security awareness training
3. **Disaster Recovery Testing:** Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures
4. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement SIEM or enhanced log monitoring
5. **Incident Response Testing:** Conduct tabletop exercises

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Target | Current | Status |
|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| High-risk items resolved within 30 days | 100% | N/A | Baseline |
| Medium-risk items resolved within 90 days | 90% | N/A | Baseline |
| Security incidents per quarter | <2 | 0 | ✅ Good |
| Compliance audit findings | 0 critical | N/A | Baseline |
| Security training completion | 100% | 100% | ✅ Good |
| Backup recovery test success rate | 95% | N/A | Need baseline |

## Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing current controls, the overall risk profile:

- **High Risk Items:** 0
- **Medium Risk Items:** 8
- **Low Risk Items:** 7
- **Overall Risk Rating:** Medium (Acceptable with continued monitoring)
