### Loading States
- A user should see loading indicators during data fetches
- A user should see skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- A user should not see layout shifts during loading

### Caching
- A user should have frequently accessed data cached
- A user should have category lists cached for quick access
- A user should have recent transactions cached

### Pagination
- A user should be able to load large transaction lists efficiently
- A user should be able to navigate through paginated results
- A user should see the total number of results

## Testing Scenarios

### Critical Path Tests
- A user should be able to complete the full flow: register → connect account → sync → categorize → budget
- A user should be able to recover from errors at any step
- A user should maintain data consistency across all operations

### Edge Cases
- A user should be able to handle accounts with no transactions
- A user should be able to handle months with no budgets
- A user should be able to handle categories with no transactions
- A user should be able to handle zero-amount transactions
