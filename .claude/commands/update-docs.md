# Update Documentation Command

Review changes made in this Claude Code session and intelligently determine if AI documentation updates are needed.

## Purpose

This command helps maintain accurate, up-to-date documentation optimized for AI agent consumption. It reviews session changes against specific criteria to avoid unnecessary documentation churn while ensuring critical updates aren't missed.

## Current Documentation Files

### Main Project Guide
@CLAUDE.md

### Architecture Documentation
@docs/AI-APPLICATION-ARCHITECTURE.md

### Deployment Documentation
@docs/AI-DEPLOYMENTS.md

### Testing Strategy
@docs/AI-TESTING-STRATEGY.md

### User Stories
@docs/AI-USER-STORIES.md

### Architecture Plan
@docs/AI-Architecture-Plan.md

## Instructions

### 1. Analyze Session Changes

Review all changes made during the current Claude Code session:
- Code modifications (new files, edited files, deleted files)
- Configuration changes (environment variables, dependencies)
- Infrastructure modifications (deployment scripts, CI/CD)
- Test additions or modifications
- Bug fixes and their root causes

### 2. Apply Documentation Update Criteria

Documentation should ONLY be updated when changes meet these criteria:

#### **MUST Update** - Critical Changes
- **Breaking changes**: Modified API contracts, removed endpoints, changed auth flow
- **New major features**: Complete user stories or significant functionality
- **Security changes**: New security requirements or authentication modifications
- **Infrastructure changes**: New deployment methods, storage backends, or services
- **Critical bug fixes**: Solutions to data loss, security issues, or system failures
- **User story updates or additions**: Changes to business requirements should always be documented.

#### **SHOULD Update** - Important Patterns
- **New architectural patterns**: Service patterns, state management, or data flow
- **Significant refactoring**: Changes affecting how developers interact with code
- **New integration points**: External services, APIs, or third-party libraries
- **Performance optimizations**: Solutions to documented performance issues
- **Common gotchas**: Newly discovered issues that future agents will encounter

#### **MAY Update** - Minor Improvements
- **Clarifications**: If existing docs caused confusion during the session
- **Missing examples**: If you had to figure out something undocumented
- **Outdated references**: File paths, method names, or configurations that changed

#### **SKIP Update** - Trivial Changes
- **Bug fixes**: Unless they reveal important patterns or gotchas
- **UI tweaks**: Minor styling or layout changes
- **Code cleanup**: Formatting, comments, or non-functional changes
- **Test additions**: Unless they demonstrate new testing patterns
- **Documentation typos**: Unless they cause actual confusion

### 3. Review Each Documentation File

With the documentation files included above, check each for potential updates:

| Document | Check For |
|----------|-----------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Project structure changes, new dependencies, development workflow updates, common task instructions |
| **AI-APPLICATION-ARCHITECTURE.md** | Service changes, API modifications, component patterns, data flow updates |
| **AI-DEPLOYMENTS.md** | Infrastructure changes, CI/CD updates, environment variables, deployment procedures |
| **AI-TESTING-STRATEGY.md** | New testing patterns, critical test examples, anti-patterns discovered |
| **AI-USER-STORIES.md** | New features, modified acceptance criteria, completed stories |
| **AI-Architecture-Plan.md** | Cost changes, infrastructure decisions, risk assessments |

### 4. Generate Documentation Review Report

## Output Format

```markdown
## Documentation Review Report

### Session Summary
[Brief description of work completed in this session - 2-3 sentences]

### Changes Analysis

#### Code Changes
- Files modified: [count]
- Features added: [list or "none"]
- Bugs fixed: [list or "none"]
- Breaking changes: [list or "none"]

#### Impact Assessment
[Which areas of the system were affected and how]

### Documentation Status

#### Updates Recommended

##### [Document Name] - [Priority: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM]
**Reason**: [Why this needs updating based on criteria]
**Specific Updates**:
- [ ] Section: [section name] - [what to add/modify]
- [ ] Add example: [what example is needed]
- [ ] Update reference: [what's outdated]

[Repeat for each document needing updates]

#### No Updates Needed
[List documents that were reviewed but don't need updates]
- **CLAUDE.md**: Current documentation remains accurate
- **AI-TESTING-STRATEGY.md**: No new patterns introduced
[etc.]

### New Documentation Considerations

#### Should Create
[Only if genuinely needed]
- **docs/AI-[TOPIC].md**: [Justification - what gap does this fill?]

#### Knowledge Gaps Identified
[Areas where documentation could be helpful but isn't critical]
- [Topic]: Would help with [use case] but not blocking

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. [Most critical update if any]
2. [Second priority if any]

#### Future Considerations
- [Documentation debt to address later]
- [Patterns to document once stable]

### Conclusion
[One of the following]:
- ‚úÖ **No documentation updates needed** - Changes don't meet update criteria
- üìù **Minor updates recommended** - Small clarifications would help
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important updates needed** - Documentation accuracy affected
- üö® **Critical updates required** - Breaking changes or major features undocumented
```

## Important Guidelines

### DO:
- Be selective - only recommend updates that add real value
- Consider AI agent needs - optimize for machine readability
- Check for accuracy - ensure existing docs aren't now wrong
- Think about discoverability - will agents find what they need?
- Suggest consolidation if documentation is fragmented

### DON'T:
- Update for the sake of updating
- Add verbose explanations that don't help agents
- Duplicate information across multiple docs
- Create new docs unless there's a clear gap
- Update timestamps or version numbers unnecessarily

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Did the session involve:
‚îú‚îÄ Breaking changes or removed features?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí MUST update affected docs
‚îú‚îÄ New major features or services?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí MUST document in appropriate guide
‚îú‚îÄ Critical bug fixes revealing patterns?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí SHOULD update with gotchas/solutions
‚îú‚îÄ New architectural patterns?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí SHOULD update architecture guide
‚îú‚îÄ Performance or security fixes?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí SHOULD document if generally applicable
‚îú‚îÄ Minor improvements or clarifications?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ MAYBE ‚Üí Only if current docs are misleading
‚îî‚îÄ Routine bug fixes or cleanup?
   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Skip documentation updates
```

## Examples of Good vs Bad Updates

### ‚úÖ Good Update Reasons
- "Added new S3 storage backend option - AI-DEPLOYMENTS.md needs storage configuration section"
- "Discovered Plaid pagination limit of 500 - AI-APPLICATION-ARCHITECTURE.md should document this constraint"
- "Refactored all services to singleton pattern - pattern should be documented for consistency"
- "Fixed critical auth bypass - security considerations should be added to CLAUDE.md"

### ‚ùå Bad Update Reasons
- "Fixed typo in variable name - should update docs" (too minor)
- "Added console.log for debugging - should document" (temporary change)
- "Improved button styling - should update architecture" (not architectural)
- "Wrote new test - should update test strategy" (unless it's a new pattern)
